#DESCRIPTION: Task 4 is about creating and using a Machine Learning (ML) model to solve a problem or make predictions. Machine Learning is a part of computer science where we teach computers to learn from data, instead of giving them strict instructions. In this task, we use data to help the computer understand patterns and make decisions automatically.
The first step in this task is to collect and understand the data. Data can come in many forms like numbers, text, or images. Before using it, we need to clean the data. Cleaning data means removing mistakes, handling missing information, and converting it into a form that the computer can use. This step is very important because good data leads to a good ML model, while bad data can make the model give wrong results.
After the data is ready, the next step is to choose the right ML model. There are different types of models depending on the problem. For example, if we want to predict a number, we use regression models. If we want to classify items into categories, like spam or not spam, we use classification models. Sometimes, we use clustering models to group similar things together without labels. The choice of model is important because it affects how well the computer learns from the data.
Next, we train the model. Training means showing the data to the model so it can learn the patterns. During training, the model adjusts itself to make accurate predictions. We also split the data into training data and testing data. Training data is used to teach the model, and testing data is used to check if the model has really learned well and can work on new, unseen data.
Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance. Evaluation means checking how accurate or correct the model’s predictions are. There are different metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or error rate, depending on the type of problem. If the model is not performing well, we may need to adjust it by choosing a better model, changing its settings (called hyperparameters), or giving it better data.
After the model performs well, it can be used for predictions. This means giving new data to the model and letting it predict outcomes automatically. This is the most important part because it solves the original problem, like predicting sales, classifying emails, or recognizing images.
In simple words, Task 4 teaches how to take data, train a computer to learn patterns, check if it works, and then use it to make decisions or predictions. It covers all the important steps of Machine Learning: data collection, cleaning, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.
This task helps in understanding how computers can “think” with data and make smart decisions. It is very practical because Machine Learning is used in many real-life applications like online recommendations, fraud detection, and self-driving cars. Task 4 gives hands-on experience with these concepts and prepares for solving real-world problems using ML models.
